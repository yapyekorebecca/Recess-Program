    --description
    Inheritance and method overriding allows a class(child class)to inherit attributes and methods from another class(parent class)
    Key concepts
    Base class (parent class): Class whose properties are inherited by another class.
    Derived class (child class): Class that inherits attributes and properties from another baseÂ class.
